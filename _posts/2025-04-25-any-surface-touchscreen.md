## Motivation
Touchscreens are everywhere, but they’re expensive to scale. We wanted to challenge that. What if any flat surface could become interactive?

## The Solution
Our project aims to turn any flat surface into an interactive touchscreen interface using LiDAR and vibration sensors to detect gestures.

### Key Technologies
* **LiDAR Sensors:** Detect finger positions.
* **FPGA (VGA):** Visualizes a virtual cursor directly onto the surface.
* **Bluetooth:** Communicates with external devices.
