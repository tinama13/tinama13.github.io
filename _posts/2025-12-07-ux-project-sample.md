## Summary

This case study investigates the course registration experience of full-time undergraduate students at the University of Michigan. Through user interviews and contextual inquiry, I explored the challenges students face when finding, evaluating, and scheduling classes. Common issues included difficulty navigating course listings, limited clarity around requirements, time pressures during registration windows, and confusion about prerequisites. By identifying these barriers, this project highlights key opportunities to simplify the interface, improve access to relevant information, and support students in creating balanced and effective schedules.
